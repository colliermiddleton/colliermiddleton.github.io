<H2> Georgia Drowning Statistics </H2>
	<p> Statistics from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention show that from 2005-2014, the average annual unintentional drowning rate across the United States was 3,636 deaths per year. This number means about 10 deaths per day across the nation. Although the age range is not limited to children, 20% that number were aged 14 or younger. This does not include the amount of children that, although did not die, received medical attention for near-drowning experiences. For every 1 incident that was fatal, 5 more incidents occurred that resulted in emergency medical care. The effects of drowning besides death can include severe brain damage that might include long term disabilities such as memory loss, loss of basic function, and long term learning disabilities.

<H2> Other Helpful Tips for Summertime Safety </h2> </div>
		<p> There are many preventative measures that can and should be taken by parents to keep kids safe during the summer.

These programs can help to teach your kids how to stay afloat in rough waters and attract attention for rescuing. These are also beneficial for the enjoyment of YOUR summer; being confident in your children's abilities creates a stress free environment for all involved.
